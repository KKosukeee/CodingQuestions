        Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of
        a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

        Example:

        Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
        Args:
            s: int value to look minimum sub-array from nums that satisifies sum(sub) >= s
            nums: list<int> to look for a minimum sub-array from
